            <span>join is an agile project management tool that allows you to visualize your tasks, limit ongoing tasks
                and
                increase efficiency or optimize workflow. It can help Agile and DevOps teams to structure their daily
                work.</span>

            <span>Under the menu item summary you have an overview of all tasks and their status. You can also see which
                tasks
                are still to be processed and which are completed. By clicking on any button you can go directly to the
                board.</span>

        <div>
            <h2>Board</h2>
            <span>Under the menu item Board you also have an overview of all tasks and their status. The tasks are
                displayed
                in cards and can be assigned to the corresponding status by drag and drop. By clicking on a card, the
                task
                is opened in an overlay and can be edited from there by clicking on the pen button. There is also a
                search
                function, with this can be searched for any task. Finally we have the Add Task button, which opens an
                overlay. In this overlay a task can be created in the booard.
            </span>

        <div>
            <h2>Add Task</h2>
            <span>Under the menu item Add Task you will find a form for creating tasks. There you can enter the title
                and
                description of the task. With the first toggle menu you can add predefined categories or create new
                categories. With the second toggle menu you can add contacts to the task or add a new one under invite
                Contacts. Next we have an input field where the due date can be selected from a calendar. This is
                followed
                by three buttons to select the priority. Finally, you can add subtasks to the form. At the end, there
                are
                two more buttons. The Clear button ensures that the form is completely emptied. With the Create Task
                button,
                a new task is created and forwarded directly to board.
